I am Star Labs StarBook MK VI user. I think, this is really nice device, but it is not very popular. Its low popularity makes it hard to find detailed information about it online. That's why I decided to create this blog, where I will write something along the lines of usable documentation to help you use the StarBook MK VI, as well as probably other devices from the company.
