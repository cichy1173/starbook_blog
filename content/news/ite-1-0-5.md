There is new ITE version that (probably) fixes issues with charging. Changelog copied from GitHub:

- Fix the charging voltage to 13.2V
- Only call Anx when USB-C PD chargers are connected
- Disable Hybrid-Power when charging current is less that 1536


EC 1.05 is included in coreboot 8.34 (testing) and coreboot 8.35 (I still waiting for confirmation about branch).
