There is a new coreboot for Starbook MK VI and for new Starbook MK VI revision 2. Rev-2 is a newer Starbook MK VI with Intel 13. gen

**What's new?**

- Based on coreboot 4.21
- Rebased on upstream edk2
- Improved power reporting
- Update EC binary to 1.17

I do not know what EC 1.17 brings. Also, It is probably a testing release. They do not released it in FWUPD yet.
