New coreboot is released. Coreboot 8.97 will be marked as stable and released in fwupd. (source: [1](https://github.com/StarLabsLtd/firmware/issues/96#issuecomment-1743674748) )

Whats new?

>   -  Rebased on edk2 master
>   -  Add a fallback for power on behaviour when CFR isnt accessible

I don't know much about EC 1.19. Only EC 1.18 was released at Github.
