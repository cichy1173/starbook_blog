There is a new coreboot release for Starbook MK VI with Intel CPU.

**What's new?**

> - Microcode update from Intel
> - Rebase on edk2 stable tag
> - Rebase on coreboot master
> - Switch to fixed bars
> - Switch to upstream fsp
> - Increase the size of the ramtop entry

new Coreboot is not released in lvfs, so I don't know the branch (I think it is testing).
