There are two new ITE-Intel releases - 1.11 and 1.10.

**ITE 1.10:**

> - Disable Hybrid Power when the RSOC is less than 20 percent
> - Only enable LEARN once when RSOC is greater than 50 percent
> - Dont query unused registers on the BQ24780S

**ITE 1.11:**

> - Adjust the threshold for Hybrid Power to 1536MA
> - Adjust the threshold for Hybrid Power to be disable to 5 percent RSOC


I think, ITE 1.11 finally fixes charging issues on Starbook MK VI. Issue isn't closed on Github, but Sean from StarLabs posted THIS:

> Thank you - same thing happening on both, `1.11` will handle that
