The Star Labs community is small, and Reddit is the only place where we can talk. Unfortunately, Reddit's recent moves have not been very pro-user. I have decided that I will probably leave Reddit in the next few days. 

I've also been a Fediverse user for over a year (Mastodon) and I know that Fediverse applications are built with the user, privacy and freedom in mind. As we are Linux users, I think it is important to use services that care about the user. I decided to create a new community for us in Fediverse. I used Lemmy for this, but I know Kbin is really cool. I already had an account on Lemmy (on szmer.info), so I used that. You can find the community here https://szmer.info/c/starlabs_computers. You can also register for different instances of Lemmy or Kbin to join our community.
