Star Labs changed the definition of StarLite line and new generation MK V is a tablet. Yes, it is a tablet with AMD64 processor (Intel N200) and with 3K screen with touch support. I love that It has a lot of ports and even micro HDMI, but micro HDMI isn't very popular. What I hate is old Intel Networking Card without WiFi 6 (AX). AX is a standard for years now.
