New Coreboot 8.39 released and it is really important. Why? This is last testing release before new stable version.

**But what's really new?**

> - Final testing release before the stable version
> - Move ramtop outside of checksummed area to fix warning about invalid checksum
> - Let coreboot configure ASPM

This is `testing` release, but next (I think Coreboot 8.40 or 8.41) should be marked as `stable`. Learn more [HERE](https://github.com/StarLabsLtd/firmware/commit/48739b3ccb920d444fa1a0adf3caa93dff9b8c39)

*I am still on Coreboot 8.31 with ITE 1.01 because of charging issues on new releases, but old fan curve is a real pain...*
