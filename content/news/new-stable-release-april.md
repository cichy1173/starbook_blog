According to [this comment](https://github.com/StarLabsLtd/firmware/issues/96#issuecomment-1493043643) Star Labs is planning release new stable release of firmware on Monday (3rd of April 2023). I think, it will be Coreboot 8.35 (not released in LVFS) or 8.36 with ITE 1.07 or 1.08 (not released yet).

Release may be delayed, but I think we will receive new update next week with shiny new fan curve, better power passthrough handling and much more! I can't wait.
